Example script: Team and TeamMembership management demonstration

This script demonstrates how to:
1. Create Employee instances
2. Create Team instances with hierarchical structure
3. Manage TeamMembership relationships over time
4. Show team transitions and leadership assignments

Scenario:
- Create 3 employees and 4 teams
- Initially all employees are in a single team
- On December 1st, move each employee to distinct teams

Run this script from anywhere by executing:
python3 003_team_example.py
